## Labs Completed

### Lab 1
- **Commands:** `ls`, `ls -l`, `ls -r`, `ls -lr`

**What They Do:**
- `ls`: Lists directory contents
- `ls -l`: Lists contents in long format, showing permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- `ls -r`: Lists contents in reverse order
- `ls -lr`: Combines both options‚Äîlists contents in long format and reverse order

**Insights:**
- Got "Permission denied" when running `ls` in some directories ‚Üí learned about file permissions
- Typing `ls-r` gave an error ‚Üí spacing matters (`ls -r` is correct)

### Lab 2
- **Commands:** `clear`, `pwd`, `cd`, `cd ..`, `cd .`, `cd ~`

**What They Do:**
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen (tidies up the workspace).
- `pwd`: Prints the working directory (shows your current location in the filesystem).
- `cd [path]`: Changes directory to the specified path.
- `cd /`: Moves to the root directory (the top of the filesystem tree).
- `cd ..`: Moves up one level to the parent directory.
- `cd .`: Refers to the current directory (not very useful with `cd`, but important later).
- `cd ~`: Returns to the home directory of the current user (`/home/sysadmin`).

**Concepts Learned:**
- Directories in Linux are like folders in Windows/Mac.
- A **path** is a list of directories separated by `/`.
- **Absolute paths** always start with `/` (e.g., `/home/sysadmin`).
- **Relative paths** use shortcuts:
  - `..` ‚Üí parent directory
  - `.` ‚Üí current directory
  - `~` ‚Üí home directory of the logged-in user

**Insights:**
- Learned that Linux always starts you in your home directory (`/home/sysadmin`) when you log in as `sysadmin`.
- Understood the difference between absolute and relative paths.
- Practiced navigating between directories using `cd` and shortcuts.

### Lab 3
- **Commands:** `ls`, `ls -l`, `ls -lt`, `ls -lS`, `ls -lr`, `ls -lSr`

**What They Do:**
- `ls`: Lists files in the current directory (alphabetical by default).
- `ls -l`: Long listing with details (file type, permissions, hard link count, owner, group, size, timestamp, filename).
- `ls -lt`: Sorts by timestamp (newest first).
- `ls -lS`: Sorts by file size (largest first).
- `ls -lr`: Reverses the order (alphabetical Z‚ÜíA).
- `ls -lSr`: Sorts by size, smallest first.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **File types:**  
  - `-` regular file, `d` directory, `b` block device, `c` character device,  
  - `s` socket, `p` pipe, `l` symbolic link.
  ![Lab 3 Screenshot](images/file_type.png)
- **Permissions:** Control read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) access for owner, group, and others.
- **Ownership:** Split into **user** (creator/owner) and **group**.
- **Hard link count:** Number of directory entries pointing to a file (directories always have at least 2).
- **File size:** Shown in bytes; directories often show multiples of the filesystem block size (commonly 4096 bytes).
- **Timestamps:** Show last modification time.
- **Symbolic links:** Display with `->` pointing to the target file.

**Insights:**
- `/var/log` is a great practice directory because it contains many file types, different owners/groups, and varied sizes/timestamps.
- Sorting options (`-t`, `-S`, `-r`) make it easier to analyze files by time, size, or order.
- Learned that a directory‚Äôs size reflects the space used to store its entries, not the total size of files inside.

**Why /var/log is used:**
- Contains a wide variety of files (regular files, directories, links).
- `ls -l /var/log` will list every file and directory entry, even if they have different owners, groups, or permissions.
- You can always *see* the files and their details (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps), but you may not be able to open or read all of them without the right privileges (e.g., some require root).
- Safe to explore with `ls` because you‚Äôre only listing, not modifying.
- Logs reflect real system activity, so sorting and listing options show meaningful differences.
- Other directories (like `/home`) may not have enough variety to demonstrate permissions, ownership, and sorting.

üì¶ **Block Size Visualization**  
Even a tiny file (like 1 byte) still consumes a full filesystem block (commonly 4096 bytes). 
This is why directories often show sizes like 4096 or 8192 ‚Äî it reflects the space used for their entries, not the total size of files inside.

### Lab 4
- **Commands:** `su`, `su -`, `su -l`, `su --login`, `exit`, `sudo`, `sudo -u`

**What They Do:**
- `su`: Switches to another user account (default is root) by opening a new shell.
- `su -`, `su -l`, `su --login`: Starts a login shell with the new user‚Äôs environment fully configured.
- `exit`: Logs out of the current shell and returns to the previous user.
- `sudo`: Executes a single command with administrative privileges (without switching users).
- `sudo -u [user] [command]`: Executes a command as a specified user.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **Administrative access** is required for sensitive commands (e.g., system-level operations).
- **`su` vs `sudo`:**
  - `su` opens a new shell as another user (usually root).
  - `sudo` runs a single command as another user (default is root), without switching shells.
- **Login shell options** (`su -`, `su --login`) ensure the new shell uses the target user‚Äôs environment.
- **Password security:** Passwords (like `netlab123`) are required but not shown when typed.
- **Prompt change:** When using `su`, the shell prompt changes to reflect the new user (e.g., `root@localhost`).
- **Steam Locomotive (`sl`) command** was used to demonstrate permission control:
  - Fails when run as `sysadmin`.
  - Succeeds when run as `root` via `su` or `sudo`.

**Insights:**
- Switching users with `su` gives full root access, which can be risky if not handled carefully.
- Using `sudo` is safer for one-off commands‚Äîit limits the scope of elevated access.
- Learned how to verify which user is active based on the shell prompt.
- Practiced using `exit` to safely return to the original user.

### Lab 5
- **Commands:** `cd`, `ls -l`

**What They Do:**
- `cd ~/Documents`: Navigates to the Documents folder in the home directory.
- `ls -l hello.sh`: Displays file details including type, permissions, owner, group, size, and timestamp.

**Concepts Learned:**
- File types: `-` for regular files, `d` for directories.
- Permissions are grouped into **Owner**, **Group**, and **Others**‚Äîeach with `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute).
- Only one permission set applies based on your relationship to the file.
- Ownership fields show who owns the file and which group it belongs to.

**Insights:**
- Permissions affect how users interact with files and directories.
- Example: `-r--rw-rwx` means the owner has read-only access, while others have more.
- Owner permissions take precedence‚Äîeven if the owner is in the group.

**Screenshot:**  
![Lab 5 Screenshot](images/lab5.png)

### Lab 6
- **Commands:** `chmod`, `ls -l`, `./hello.sh`

**What They Do:**
- `chmod u+x hello.sh`: Adds execute permission for the user owner of the file.
- `ls -l hello.sh`: Verifies permission changes.
- `./hello.sh`: Executes the script from the current directory.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **chmod** stands for ‚Äúchange mode‚Äù (not ‚Äúchange permission‚Äù) because permissions were historically called modes of access.
- **Symbolic method** of `chmod` uses:
  - `u`, `g`, `o`, `a` to target user, group, others, or all.
  - `+`, `-`, `=` to add, remove, or set exact permissions.
  - `r`, `w`, `x` for read, write, and execute.
- Only the **file owner or root** can change permissions.
- Without execute permission, a script like `hello.sh` cannot be run‚Äîeven if readable.
- Adding `x` for the user owner enables script execution.

**Insights:**
- Using `chmod u+x` is a safe way to grant execution rights without affecting group or others.
- `./hello.sh` runs the script from the current directory‚Äîthis avoids relying on the system‚Äôs PATH.
- After permission is granted, the script runs successfully and prints ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù

### Lab 7

#### üîê Changing File Ownership

**Commands:** `chown`, `sudo`, `ls -l`, `./hello.sh`

**What They Do:**
- `chown [OWNER] FILE`: Changes the user owner of a file (requires `sudo`).
- `sudo chown root hello.sh`: Transfers ownership of `hello.sh` to root.
- `ls -l hello.sh`: Verifies ownership change.
- `sudo ./hello.sh`: Executes the script as root since only root has execute permission.

**Insights:**
- Only root can change file ownership.
- After ownership changes, permissions must be reassessed‚Äîexecution may fail if the new owner is the only one with `x` permission.
- Using `sudo` allows execution under root privileges.

---

#### üìÑ Viewing File Contents

**Commands:** `cat`, `head`, `tail`

**What They Do:**
- `cat [FILE]`: Displays the entire file‚Äîbest for small files.
- `head [FILE]`: Shows the first 10 lines.
- `tail [FILE]`: Shows the last 10 lines.
- `head -n [number] [FILE]`: Views a specific number of lines from the top.
- `tail -n [number] [FILE]`: Views a specific number of lines from the bottom.

**Insights:**
- Use `cat` for quick checks.
- Use `head` and `tail` for large or frequently updated files.
- `-n` option customizes output length for better control.

### Lab 8

#### üìÅ Copying Files with `cp`

**Commands:** `cp`, `diff`, `ls`

**What They Do:**
- `cp [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]`: Copies a file from one location to another.
- `cp /etc/passwd .`: Copies `/etc/passwd` into the current directory (`.` = current directory).
- `cp /etc/passwd passwd_backup`: Creates a copy named `passwd_backup` in the current directory.
- `ls`: Lists files to confirm the copy exists.


#### üîç Verifying the Copy with `diff`

**Commands:** `diff`

**What They Do:**
- `diff FILE1 FILE2`: Compares two files line by line.
- `diff /etc/passwd passwd_backup`: Confirms whether the backup is identical to the original.
  - If there's **no output**, the files are **identical**.
  - If there is output, it shows the differences line by line.

#### üîê Permission Requirements

**To successfully copy a file:**
- ‚úÖ **Read permission** on the source file.
- ‚úÖ **Execute permission** on the source directory.
- ‚úÖ **Write + execute permission** on the destination directory.

**Common writable directories:**
- Your home directory (`~/`)
- `/tmp` ‚Äî a shared space for temporary files

#### üí° Use Cases for Copying Files

- Create backups before editing.
- Transfer files to external devices.
- Use existing files as templates for new ones.
- Compare versions using `diff`.

### Lab 9

#### üìÇ Moving Files with `mv`

**Commands:** `mv`, `ls`, `cd`

**What They Do:**
- `mv [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]`: Moves a file from one location to another.
- `mv people.csv Work`: Moves `people.csv` into the `Work` directory.
- `mv numbers.txt letters.txt alpha.txt School`: Moves multiple files into the `School` directory.
- `mv animals.txt zoo.txt`: Renames `animals.txt` to `zoo.txt` within the same directory.
- `ls`: Lists files to confirm the move or rename.
- `cd ~/Documents`: Navigates to the working directory.

#### üîç Verifying the Move

**Commands:** `ls`

**What They Do:**
- `ls Work`: Confirms that `people.csv` was successfully moved.
- `ls School`: Verifies that multiple files were moved.
- `ls`: Shows that `animals.txt` was renamed to `zoo.txt`.

#### üîê Permission Requirements

**To successfully move a file:**
- ‚úÖ **Write + execute permission** on the source directory.
- ‚úÖ **Write + execute permission** on the destination directory.

**Why It Matters:**
- Without execute permission, you can‚Äôt access the directory.
- Without write permission, you can‚Äôt modify its contents (e.g., move or rename files).

#### üí° Use Cases for Moving Files

- Organize files into folders (e.g., move documents into `Work` or `School`).
- Rename files for clarity or versioning.
- Clean up clutter by relocating files.
- Batch move multiple files with a single command.

### Lab 10

#### üóëÔ∏è Removing Files with `rm`

**Commands:** `rm`, `ls`, `cd`, `-r`, `-R`

**What They Do:**
- `rm [OPTIONS] FILE`: Removes files or directories.
- `rm filename`: Deletes a regular file.
- `rm -r directory`: Recursively removes a directory and all its contents.
- `cd ~/Documents`: Changes into the `Documents` directory.
- `ls`: Lists files to verify removal.

**Important:**  
Unlike desktop systems, Linux does **not** have a ‚Äútrash can.‚Äù  
When you delete a file with `rm`, it is **permanently removed**.

**üîê Permission Requirements**
- To successfully delete a file:
- ‚úÖ Write + execute permission on the directory containing the file.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Understanding Destructive Commands

**Example:**
```bash
sudo rm -rf /
```

**Impact & Recovery**
**Impact:**
- System files, user data, and boot components are wiped.
- Even basic tools needed for recovery are deleted.

**Why Recovery Is Hard:**
- OS becomes unbootable.
- No shell or package manager remains.
- Recovery requires a full backup or clean reinstall.

**How to Protect Yourself**
- Back up files regularly.
- Use safer deletion:
```bash
rm -i filename
```
- Avoid `sudo` with destructive commands.
- Lock critical files:
```bash
chattr +i filename
```

### Lab 11

#### üîç Filtering Input with `grep`

**Commands:** `grep`, `cd`, `cp`, `cat`

**What They Do:**
- `grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE]`: Searches text and displays lines matching a pattern.  
- `cd ~/Documents`: Changes into the `Documents` directory.  
- `cp /etc/passwd .`: Copies the `/etc/passwd` file to the current directory.  
- `cat filename`: Displays the contents of a file.  

**Example:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents
cp /etc/passwd .
grep sysadmin passwd
````

**Output:**

```
sysadmin:x:1001:1001:System Administrator,,,,:/home/sysadmin:/bin/bash
```

This line is the `/etc/passwd` entry for the `sysadmin` user.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions enhance search capability in `grep`.

**Basic Regex Characters:**

| Character | Meaning                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `.`       | Any single character                         |
| `[ ]`     | Any one specified character                  |
| `[^ ]`    | Any one *not* specified character            |
| `*`       | Zero or more of the previous character       |
| `^`       | Match pattern at the **beginning** of a line |
| `$`       | Match pattern at the **end** of a line       |

**Extended Regex Characters (use `grep -E` or `egrep`):**

| Character | Meaning                                    |            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `+`       | One or more of the previous pattern        |            |
| `?`       | The preceding pattern is optional          |            |
| `{ }`     | Specify minimum, maximum, or exact matches |            |
| `         | `                                          | Logical OR |
| `( )`     | Group expressions                          |            |

---

#### üß± Basic Pattern Examples

**Search for a literal pattern:**

```bash
grep sysadmin passwd
```

**Anchor Characters:**

```bash
grep '^root' /etc/passwd     # Match lines starting with "root"
grep 'r$' alpha-first.txt    # Match lines ending with "r"
```

**Match a single character (`.`):**

```bash
grep 'r..f' red.txt
```

Matches: `reef`, `roof`

**Match character ranges (`[]`):**

```bash
grep '[0-9]' profile.txt
```

Matches lines containing numbers.

**Negate characters (`[^ ]`):**

```bash
grep '[^0-9]' profile.txt
```

Matches lines with non-numeric characters.

**Match repeated characters (`*`):**

```bash
grep 're*d' red.txt
```

Matches: `red`, `reed`, `reeed`

**Multiple options with ranges:**

```bash
grep 'r[oe]*d' red.txt
```

Matches: `red`, `rod`, `reed`

---

#### üí° Standard Input Mode

If no file is provided, `grep` reads from **standard input**:

```bash
grep pattern
```

Type text and press **Ctrl + D** to end input.

---

#### üè† Return to Home Directory

```bash
cd ~
```

---

**Summary:**

* `grep` filters and searches for text patterns efficiently.
* Regular expressions allow complex searches.
* Use quotes (`' '`) to protect patterns from shell interpretation.

## üêß Fun Fact: Penguins in Space!

- **NASA Uses Linux** üöÄ  
  The **International Space Station** runs on Linux for stability and reliability.  

- **Curiosity Rover on Mars** üî≠  
  The Mars rover also relies on Linux to carry out its mission on the Red Planet.  

- **Why Linux?**  
  NASA migrated key functions from Windows to Linux because they needed an operating system that was:
  - Stable  
  - Reliable  
  - Open-source and customizable  

Linux isn‚Äôt just powering servers and desktops ‚Äî it‚Äôs literally running in **outer space**!

## Bonus: Easter Egg Discovery
- **Command Used:** `aptitude moo`
- **What It Does:** Displays a humorous message‚Äî‚ÄúThere are no Easter Eggs in this program.‚Äù
- **Insight:** This is a hidden joke built into the `aptitude` package manager. If you keep adding `-v` flags (like `aptitude -v moo`, `aptitude -vv moo`), you‚Äôll uncover more playful responses.

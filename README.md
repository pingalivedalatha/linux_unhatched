“My progress through Cisco’s Linux Unhatched labs"

## Labs Completed
- **Lab 1:**
  - Commands: 'ls''ls -l''ls -r''ls-lr'
  
  **What They Do:**
  - `ls`: Lists directory contents
  - `ls -l`: Lists contents in long format, showing permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
  - `ls -r`: Lists contents in reverse order.
  - `ls -lr`: Combines both options—lists contents in long format and reverse order.
- **Insights:** LS is wrong - permission is denied.ls-r is wrong, the space is mandatory.

## Bonus: Easter Egg Discovery

- **Command Used:** `aptitude moo`
- **What It Does:** Displays a humorous message—“There are no Easter Eggs in this program.”
- **Insight:** This is a hidden joke built into the `aptitude` package manager. If you keep adding `-v` flags (like `aptitude -v moo`, `aptitude -vv moo`), you’ll uncover more playful responses.

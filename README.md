“My progress through Cisco’s Linux Unhatched labs"

This repository documents my journey through Cisco’s Linux Unhatched labs, including commands, insights, and screenshots.

## Labs Completed

### Lab 1
- **Commands:** `ls`, `ls -l`, `ls -r`, `ls -lr`

**What They Do:**
- `ls`: Lists directory contents
- `ls -l`: Lists contents in long format, showing permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- `ls -r`: Lists contents in reverse order
- `ls -lr`: Combines both options—lists contents in long format and reverse order

**Insights:**
- Got "Permission denied" when running `ls` in some directories → learned about file permissions
- Typing `ls-r` gave an error → spacing matters (`ls -r` is correct)

### Lab 2
- **Commands:** `clear`, `pwd`, `cd`, `cd ..`, `cd .`, `cd ~`

**What They Do:**
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen (tidies up the workspace).
- `pwd`: Prints the working directory (shows your current location in the filesystem).
- `cd [path]`: Changes directory to the specified path.
- `cd /`: Moves to the root directory (the top of the filesystem tree).
- `cd ..`: Moves up one level to the parent directory.
- `cd .`: Refers to the current directory (not very useful with `cd`, but important later).
- `cd ~`: Returns to the home directory of the current user (`/home/sysadmin`).

**Concepts Learned:**
- Directories in Linux are like folders in Windows/Mac.
- A **path** is a list of directories separated by `/`.
- **Absolute paths** always start with `/` (e.g., `/home/sysadmin`).
- **Relative paths** use shortcuts:
  - `..` → parent directory
  - `.` → current directory
  - `~` → home directory of the logged-in user

**Insights:**
- Learned that Linux always starts you in your home directory (`/home/sysadmin`) when you log in as `sysadmin`.
- Understood the difference between absolute and relative paths.
- Practiced navigating between directories using `cd` and shortcuts.

### Lab 3
- **Commands:** `ls`, `ls -l`, `ls -lt`, `ls -lS`, `ls -lr`, `ls -lSr`

**What They Do:**
- `ls`: Lists files in the current directory (alphabetical by default).
- `ls -l`: Long listing with details (file type, permissions, hard link count, owner, group, size, timestamp, filename).
- `ls -lt`: Sorts by timestamp (newest first).
- `ls -lS`: Sorts by file size (largest first).
- `ls -lr`: Reverses the order (alphabetical Z→A).
- `ls -lSr`: Sorts by size, smallest first.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **File types:**  
  - `-` regular file, `d` directory, `b` block device, `c` character device,  
  - `s` socket, `p` pipe, `l` symbolic link.

- **Permissions:** Control read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) access for owner, group, and others.
- **Ownership:** Split into **user** (creator/owner) and **group**.
- **Hard link count:** Number of directory entries pointing to a file (directories always have at least 2).
- **File size:** Shown in bytes; directories often show multiples of the filesystem block size (commonly 4096 bytes).
- **Timestamps:** Show last modification time.
- **Symbolic links:** Display with `->` pointing to the target file.

**Insights:**
- `/var/log` is a great practice directory because it contains many file types, different owners/groups, and varied sizes/timestamps.
- Sorting options (`-t`, `-S`, `-r`) make it easier to analyze files by time, size, or order.
- Learned that a directory’s size reflects the space used to store its entries, not the total size of files inside.

**Why /var/log is used:**
- Contains a wide variety of files (regular files, directories, links).
- `ls -l /var/log` will list every file and directory entry, even if they have different owners, groups, or permissions.
- You can always *see* the files and their details (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps), but you may not be able to open or read all of them without the right privileges (e.g., some require root).
- Safe to explore with `ls` because you’re only listing, not modifying.
- Logs reflect real system activity, so sorting and listing options show meaningful differences.
- Other directories (like `/home`) may not have enough variety to demonstrate permissions, ownership, and sorting.

📦 **Block Size Visualization**  
Even a tiny file (like 1 byte) still consumes a full filesystem block (commonly 4096 bytes). 
This is why directories often show sizes like 4096 or 8192 — it reflects the space used for their entries, not the total size of files inside.

## Bonus: Easter Egg Discovery
- **Command Used:** `aptitude moo`
- **What It Does:** Displays a humorous message—“There are no Easter Eggs in this program.”
- **Insight:** This is a hidden joke built into the `aptitude` package manager. If you keep adding `-v` flags (like `aptitude -v moo`, `aptitude -vv moo`), you’ll uncover more playful responses.

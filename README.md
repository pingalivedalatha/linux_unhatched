## Labs Completed

### Lab 1
- **Commands:** `ls`, `ls -l`, `ls -r`, `ls -lr`

**What They Do:**
- `ls`: Lists directory contents
- `ls -l`: Lists contents in long format, showing permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- `ls -r`: Lists contents in reverse order
- `ls -lr`: Combines both options‚Äîlists contents in long format and reverse order

**Insights:**
- Got "Permission denied" when running `ls` in some directories ‚Üí learned about file permissions
- Typing `ls-r` gave an error ‚Üí spacing matters (`ls -r` is correct)

### Lab 2
- **Commands:** `clear`, `pwd`, `cd`, `cd ..`, `cd .`, `cd ~`

**What They Do:**
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen (tidies up the workspace).
- `pwd`: Prints the working directory (shows your current location in the filesystem).
- `cd [path]`: Changes directory to the specified path.
- `cd /`: Moves to the root directory (the top of the filesystem tree).
- `cd ..`: Moves up one level to the parent directory.
- `cd .`: Refers to the current directory (not very useful with `cd`, but important later).
- `cd ~`: Returns to the home directory of the current user (`/home/sysadmin`).

**Concepts Learned:**
- Directories in Linux are like folders in Windows/Mac.
- A **path** is a list of directories separated by `/`.
- **Absolute paths** always start with `/` (e.g., `/home/sysadmin`).
- **Relative paths** use shortcuts:
  - `..` ‚Üí parent directory
  - `.` ‚Üí current directory
  - `~` ‚Üí home directory of the logged-in user

**Insights:**
- Learned that Linux always starts you in your home directory (`/home/sysadmin`) when you log in as `sysadmin`.
- Understood the difference between absolute and relative paths.
- Practiced navigating between directories using `cd` and shortcuts.

### Lab 3
- **Commands:** `ls`, `ls -l`, `ls -lt`, `ls -lS`, `ls -lr`, `ls -lSr`

**What They Do:**
- `ls`: Lists files in the current directory (alphabetical by default).
- `ls -l`: Long listing with details (file type, permissions, hard link count, owner, group, size, timestamp, filename).
- `ls -lt`: Sorts by timestamp (newest first).
- `ls -lS`: Sorts by file size (largest first).
- `ls -lr`: Reverses the order (alphabetical Z‚ÜíA).
- `ls -lSr`: Sorts by size, smallest first.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **File types:**  
  - `-` regular file, `d` directory, `b` block device, `c` character device,  
  - `s` socket, `p` pipe, `l` symbolic link.
  ![Lab 3 Screenshot](images/file_type.png)
- **Permissions:** Control read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) access for owner, group, and others.
- **Ownership:** Split into **user** (creator/owner) and **group**.
- **Hard link count:** Number of directory entries pointing to a file (directories always have at least 2).
- **File size:** Shown in bytes; directories often show multiples of the filesystem block size (commonly 4096 bytes).
- **Timestamps:** Show last modification time.
- **Symbolic links:** Display with `->` pointing to the target file.

**Insights:**
- `/var/log` is a great practice directory because it contains many file types, different owners/groups, and varied sizes/timestamps.
- Sorting options (`-t`, `-S`, `-r`) make it easier to analyze files by time, size, or order.
- Learned that a directory‚Äôs size reflects the space used to store its entries, not the total size of files inside.

**Why /var/log is used:**
- Contains a wide variety of files (regular files, directories, links).
- `ls -l /var/log` will list every file and directory entry, even if they have different owners, groups, or permissions.
- You can always *see* the files and their details (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps), but you may not be able to open or read all of them without the right privileges (e.g., some require root).
- Safe to explore with `ls` because you‚Äôre only listing, not modifying.
- Logs reflect real system activity, so sorting and listing options show meaningful differences.
- Other directories (like `/home`) may not have enough variety to demonstrate permissions, ownership, and sorting.

üì¶ **Block Size Visualization**  
Even a tiny file (like 1 byte) still consumes a full filesystem block (commonly 4096 bytes). 
This is why directories often show sizes like 4096 or 8192 ‚Äî it reflects the space used for their entries, not the total size of files inside.

### Lab 4
- **Commands:** `su`, `su -`, `su -l`, `su --login`, `exit`, `sudo`, `sudo -u`

**What They Do:**
- `su`: Switches to another user account (default is root) by opening a new shell.
- `su -`, `su -l`, `su --login`: Starts a login shell with the new user‚Äôs environment fully configured.
- `exit`: Logs out of the current shell and returns to the previous user.
- `sudo`: Executes a single command with administrative privileges (without switching users).
- `sudo -u [user] [command]`: Executes a command as a specified user.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **Administrative access** is required for sensitive commands (e.g., system-level operations).
- **`su` vs `sudo`:**
  - `su` opens a new shell as another user (usually root).
  - `sudo` runs a single command as another user (default is root), without switching shells.
- **Login shell options** (`su -`, `su --login`) ensure the new shell uses the target user‚Äôs environment.
- **Password security:** Passwords (like `netlab123`) are required but not shown when typed.
- **Prompt change:** When using `su`, the shell prompt changes to reflect the new user (e.g., `root@localhost`).
- **Steam Locomotive (`sl`) command** was used to demonstrate permission control:
  - Fails when run as `sysadmin`.
  - Succeeds when run as `root` via `su` or `sudo`.

**Insights:**
- Switching users with `su` gives full root access, which can be risky if not handled carefully.
- Using `sudo` is safer for one-off commands‚Äîit limits the scope of elevated access.
- Learned how to verify which user is active based on the shell prompt.
- Practiced using `exit` to safely return to the original user.

### Lab 5
- **Commands:** `cd`, `ls -l`

**What They Do:**
- `cd ~/Documents`: Navigates to the Documents folder in the home directory.
- `ls -l hello.sh`: Displays file details including type, permissions, owner, group, size, and timestamp.

**Concepts Learned:**
- File types: `-` for regular files, `d` for directories.
- Permissions are grouped into **Owner**, **Group**, and **Others**‚Äîeach with `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute).
- Only one permission set applies based on your relationship to the file.
- Ownership fields show who owns the file and which group it belongs to.

**Insights:**
- Permissions affect how users interact with files and directories.
- Example: `-r--rw-rwx` means the owner has read-only access, while others have more.
- Owner permissions take precedence‚Äîeven if the owner is in the group.

### Lab 6
- **Commands:** `chmod`, `ls -l`, `./hello.sh`

**What They Do:**
- `chmod u+x hello.sh`: Adds execute permission for the user owner of the file.
- `ls -l hello.sh`: Verifies permission changes.
- `./hello.sh`: Executes the script from the current directory.

**Concepts Learned:**
- **chmod** stands for ‚Äúchange mode‚Äù (not ‚Äúchange permission‚Äù) because permissions were historically called modes of access.
- **Symbolic method** of `chmod` uses:
  - `u`, `g`, `o`, `a` to target user, group, others, or all.
  - `+`, `-`, `=` to add, remove, or set exact permissions.
  - `r`, `w`, `x` for read, write, and execute.
- Only the **file owner or root** can change permissions.
- Without execute permission, a script like `hello.sh` cannot be run‚Äîeven if readable.
- Adding `x` for the user owner enables script execution.

**Insights:**
- Using `chmod u+x` is a safe way to grant execution rights without affecting group or others.
- `./hello.sh` runs the script from the current directory‚Äîthis avoids relying on the system‚Äôs PATH.
- After permission is granted, the script runs successfully and prints ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù

## Bonus: Easter Egg Discovery
- **Command Used:** `aptitude moo`
- **What It Does:** Displays a humorous message‚Äî‚ÄúThere are no Easter Eggs in this program.‚Äù
- **Insight:** This is a hidden joke built into the `aptitude` package manager. If you keep adding `-v` flags (like `aptitude -v moo`, `aptitude -vv moo`), you‚Äôll uncover more playful responses.
